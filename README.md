# P5_Web_Portfolio
final project for NYU web design course. It is a portfolio website displaying my P5 works during the semester.

### description
This is a page showcasing the various p5js projects I made in my creative computing class this semester. 
I will be using html, css for basic layout and finding the most appropriate way to interact (e.g. experimenting with the possibility of putting p5 directly into the page, or adding the three.js library to make simple 3D interactions).
I will divide the page into an artwork section and an article section. 
- The work section will be divided into modules such as "Basic p5 examples", "Particle systems" and "Machine learning"
- In addition, there will be an "artist profile" module on the page to briefly introduce myself and the role of this site
